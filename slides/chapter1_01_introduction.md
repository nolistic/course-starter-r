# An example API flow

When you open up the weather app on your phone, it probably: 

1. Gets your GPS coordinates
2. Calls a location API with your GPS coordinates.
3. Gets back the nearest city to you.
4. Calls a weather.com API with your current city.
5. Gets back the forecast for your location.
6. Displays this information on your screen.
